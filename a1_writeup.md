# Assignment 1 - Write UP

## Description
This is the portion of the assignment that will be graded.  I will be looking at your other files, and specifically either `a1.py` or `a1_practice_problems.py`.  I will be looking to see that you completed the problems or used a generative AI to help you come up with and complete some challenge questions.  This document will help guide you through that process.

## What You Need to Submit
1. **Complete the `a1_practice_problems.py` in class**.  Mr. Berg will push solutions to github
2. **Complete the `a1.py` file** with your AI-generated problems and solutions
3. **Complete the reflection questions** in `a1_writeup.md`
4. **Push your changes to GitHub**

Mr. Berg will look at all your files to determine what you have completed.  If there are any questions for this assignment, Mr. Berg will ask in class after he grades them.


## Reflection Questions

After completing your problems, reflect on:

1. **What was your initial experience with Python?** How did it compare to other programming languages you've used?
I found Python to be complicated since it was the first time I was using it but I found it somewhat similar to Javascript. I also thought that Python was less wordy and used less characters when writing the code, while for Javascript I had to write more just to do the same thing. For example, in the every other function when using Python it just used up a line of code while when doing it with Javascript it took up around 5 lines of code.

2. **How did you use AI effectively?** Give specific examples of good prompts you used and what you learned from the responses.
I used AI effectively by first telling it "I'm learning Python basics in a high school programming class. I have some experience from my AP CSP class. Can you create 6 practice problems that cover: 
> - Variables and basic data types
> - Conditionals (if/elif/else)
> - Loops (for and while)
> - Functions
> - Basic list operations
> 
> Make them progressively more challenging. Make sure each problem has clear instructions and example inputs/outputs." Then asking it to "explain in detail how they each work, how the input leads to the output". Then ChatGPT generated explanations to all of the solutions. Something that I learned from the responses is how Python is very similar to Javascript, for example when writing functions it had a very similar structure to the functions in Javascript, this gave me an idea of 

3. **What concepts were most challenging?** How did AI help you understand them?
Most of the concepts to me were challenging since it was my first time using Python so I didn't know how to write the code in pythonic code, but I think the most challenging one were writing if and else statements since the structure of them was very distinct from if it was done by using Javascript, I felt like in Python they had 

4. **What did you learn about collaborating with AI?** What strategies worked best for learning rather than just getting answers?
Something that I learned about collaborating with AI was that it can be very helpful if you know how to use it right. When I needed help understanding how a
