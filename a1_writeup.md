# Assignment 1 - Write UP

## Description
This is the portion of the assignment that will be graded.  I will be looking at your other files, and specifically either `a1.py` or `a1_practice_problems.py`.  I will be looking to see that you completed the problems or used a generative AI to help you come up with and complete some challenge questions.  This document will help guide you through that process.

## What You Need to Submit
1. **Complete the `a1_practice_problems.py` in class**.  Mr. Berg will push solutions to github
2. **Complete the `a1.py` file** with your AI-generated problems and solutions
3. **Complete the reflection questions** in `a1_writeup.md`
4. **Push your changes to GitHub**

Mr. Berg will look at all your files to determine what you have completed.  If there are any questions for this assignment, Mr. Berg will ask in class after he grades them.


## Reflection Questions

After completing your problems, reflect on:

1. **What was your initial experience with Python?** How did it compare to other programming languages you've used?
I found Python to be complicated since it was the first time I was using it but I found it somewhat similar to Javascript. I also thought that Python was less wordy and used less characters when writing the code, while for Javascript I had to write more just to do the same thing. For example, in the every other function when using Python it just used up a line of code while when doing it with Javascript it took up around 5 lines of code.

2. **How did you use AI effectively?** Give specific examples of good prompts you used and what you learned from the responses.

3. **What concepts were most challenging?** How did AI help you understand them?

4. **What did you learn about collaborating with AI?** What strategies worked best for learning rather than just getting answers?
